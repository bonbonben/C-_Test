Gaming Rule
• A random sequence of tetrominoes fall down the playing field (a rectangular vertical shaft, called the "well" or "matrix").
• The objective of the game is to manipulate these tetrominoes, by moving each one sideways and rotating it by 90 degree units, 
with the aim of creating a horizontal line of blocks without gaps.
• When such a line is created, it disappears, and any block above the deleted line will fall.
• The game ends when the stack of tetrominoes reaches the top of the playing field and no new tetrominoes are able to enter.

Basic Requirements:
• Develop an interactive tetris game
You can use ncurses library for a text-based Unix environment or other libraries for various GUI environments
• Use inheritance to design your tetrominoes
• Use operator overloading for operations
• Use new / delete to dynamically allocate / release your tetrominoes objects

Detailed Requirements:
• Battle Mode!
• Moving cursor. (DO NOT repaint your screen)
• Display elapsed time and score on the screen.
• Tetrominos can be accelerated to fall down.
• At least 7 kinds of tetrominos in your game.
